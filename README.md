# Task-42__Capstone-Project-VI
A full website design and build. This website utilises vanilla HTML, CSS &amp; JS. I have focused on a clean design with a mini-design system and framework created in CSS and JS providing the functionality.  The main KLPs were to add the JS functionality, in particular the save, like, comment and my-account features using localStorage at this stage.
