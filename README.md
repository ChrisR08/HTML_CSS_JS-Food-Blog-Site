## Overview

This project is a full website design and build that utilises vanilla HTML, CSS & JS. The focus was on a clean design with a mini-design system and framework created in CSS and JS that provides functionality. The main key learning points were to add the JS functionality, in particular the "Save for Later", "Like", "Comment", and "My Account" features using local storage at this stage.

## Features

- "Save for Later" page: Users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be able to go back and see them later. Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to "Save for Later". When an item is added, an alert tells the user how many items are in their "Save for Later" folder.
- "Save for Later" HTML page: A new HTML page for the "Save for Later" section allows the user to see what is in their folder.
- Comment form: A form that allows a user to leave comments.
- "Like" forms: Forms that allow a user to "like" an item/article/etc.
- Contact form: Forms for if a person would like to contact you.
