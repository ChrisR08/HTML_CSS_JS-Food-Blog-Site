Build a complete website with Vanilla HTML, CSS & Javascript.


## Overview
This project is a full website design and build that utilises HTML, CSS & JS. The focus was on a clean design with a mini-design system and framework created in CSS and JS that provides functionality. The main key learning points were to add the JS functionality, in particular the "Save for Later", "Like", "Comment", and "My Account" features using local storage at this stage.

- "Save for Later" HTML page: A new HTML page for the "Save for Later" section allows the user to see what is in their folder.

## Accessibility and SEO/Optimization
This project has been designed with accessibility and SEO/optimization in mind. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices, and has been built with clean, semantic HTML and well-structured CSS to ensure that it is easy to read and navigate. The website also follows best practices for SEO, including the use of appropriate meta tags, alt attributes on images, and descriptive page titles and headings.


## Future Development
In the future, we plan to continue to improve the functionality of the website and add additional features. This may include enhanced user account functionality, improved commenting and social media integration, and more.
